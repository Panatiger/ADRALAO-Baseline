Executive Summary
This report presents a baseline analysis for the Nature-Based Social Inclusive Livelihood and Climate Action Project (NaBCAP) in Kham District, Xiengkhouang Province. Based on a household survey of 378 respondents, the findings provide significant initial results to guide and measure project impact over the time of its implementation.
Key Baseline Findings:
●	Poverty: 60.3% of households are poor.
●	Vulnerability: 60.3% of respondents are female; 56% are from households with persons with disabilities (PWD).
●	Education: 35% never attended school, and 45.8% completed only primary education.
●	Agricultural Yields: 32.5% reported increased yields (males: 39.3%, females: 28.1%).
●	Livelihood Access: Only 17.5% reported improved access and control over livelihood resources—lower for females (12.7%) and female-headed households (4.9%).
●	Forest Management: 53.4% perceived improvements, with higher rates among males (68.0%) than females (43.9%).
●	Land Use Planning: 40.0% reported having effective land use plans (males: 52.0%, females: 32.0%).
●	Advocacy Capacity: Only 24.6% reported the ability to advocate for their needs, especially low among women and PWD households.

Conclusion and Recommendations
The data shows NaBCAP works in a context of high poverty, limited education, and pronounced gender and social disparities. To address these challenges, the project should prioritize support for vulnerable groups—especially poor, female, and PWD households. This includes tailored livelihood assistance, accessible training, and inclusive planning. Strengthening advocacy skills and ensuring communication materials are simple and culturally appropriate need to be prioritized. Embedding gender equality, disability inclusion, and adaptive learning throughout implementation is key to achieving sustainable impact.



 
Project Overview
The Nature-Based Social Inclusive Livelihood and Climate Action Project (NaBCAP) is a four-year initiative undertaken by the Adventist Development and Relief Agency (ADRA) Laos, in partnership with ADRA Australia. The project aims to strengthen the institutional and community capacity of vulnerable smallholder farmers, including women, people with disabilities, and poor households, across 20 villages within Kham District. Its core focus is on improving natural resource management (land, forest, and water), agricultural systems, and climate services, while also fostering diverse and inclusive livelihood opportunities.
NaBCAP employs multi-sectoral, socially inclusive, and gender-informed Nature-Based Solutions (NBS) approaches. This methodology involves collaboration with various government departments, local civil societies, and the private sector to address local needs and enhance adaptation capacities to climate change impacts.
The overarching goal of the project is to achieve sustainable economic growth, environmental protection, climate change resilience, and improved well-being for vulnerable farming communities in Kham District, Xiengkhouang Province. This goal is supported by three key outcomes:
1.	Increased Livelihood Opportunities: Climate-vulnerable households are expected to experience enhanced livelihood opportunities through the application of Nature-Based Solution approaches.
2.	Effective Land and Water Management: Communities and stakeholders are anticipated to develop and adopt effective land and water management systems using Nature-Based Solution approaches.
3.	Increased Access to Inclusive Climate Action Services: Communities and implementing partners are to gain improved access to inclusive and climate action services in Lao PDR through advocacy efforts.

Project Location
The NaBCAP project is implemented in 20 villages within Kham District, Xiengkhouang Province, Lao PDR. Xiengkhouang Province is in northeastern Laos. Kham District, where the project activities are concentrated, is characterized by its rural setting and significant poverty rates.
The selection of these 20 villages was based on their geographical position, high vulnerability and poverty rates, and their proximity to protected forest areas. The project has the intention to support 1,029 (60%) vulnerable households out of a total of 1,718 households in these target villages.

Purpose of the Baseline Survey
The baseline survey was conducted to gather a comprehensive range of information, enabling ADRA Laos to systematically assess the existing conditions and challenges in the target villages at the beginning of the implementation of NaBCAP activities. This baseline survey data will serve as a foundational benchmark and is crucial for evaluating the initial targets.
Specifically, the baseline survey aims to
●	Establish Baseline Values: It assessed the initial situation of the project contexts and determined the baseline values for the logical framework indicators. These values were intended to serve as a basis for measuring changes brought about by the intervention at both the midterm and end of the project.
●	Inform Monitoring and Evaluation: The data collected provided a basis for the project team and independent evaluators to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of the project, allowing for the tracking of changes and the measurement of impact resulting from implemented interventions.
●	Support Evidence-Based Decision-Making: The findings from the survey were intended to assist ADRA and other stakeholders in making informed, evidence-based decisions throughout the project lifecycle.
●	Guide Future Action: The survey's insights were expected to offer guidance for subsequent project activities and planning.
●	Foster Collaboration and Knowledge Transfer: The process of conducting the baseline survey also aimed to foster a collaborative environment and enhance knowledge transfer among various stakeholders.
●	Bridge Data Gaps: It sought to provide information and data that addressed gaps in understanding related to climate adaptation, natural resource management, food security, livelihoods, and social inclusion and equality.
●	Confirm Relevance of NBS: The survey evaluated and confirmed the relevance of the project's emphasis on nature-based solutions.
●	Ascertain Needs and Opportunities: It ascertained the primary needs and challenges of the target population, as well as identified opportunities for intervention.
The data collection for this baseline survey was completed by ADRA Laos, and the consultant's role, as per TOR, was primarily focused on data analysis and report writing.
Methodology
The baseline survey used a quantitative research approach, utilizing structured interviews and household surveys to collect data from the field.
Sampling: A stratified random sampling method was used. This approach involved the random selection of samples from subgroups of the target population, based on household characteristics relevant to the project's target groups. The proposed sample size was 380 individuals out of a total population of 10,701 people, calculated with a 95% confidence level and a 5% confidence interval . The sampling consisted of 173 households with people with disabilities (PWD HHs), 88 female-headed households (FHHs), and 119 poor households.
Data Collection Tools: The survey used the electronic platform "Harvest Your Data Survey Application." A quantitative method was used to build the questionnaires, which were then uploaded onto tablets for use during collection fieldwork.
Key Indicators and Themes: The survey measured key indicators and variables categorized across several thematic areas, including
●	Livelihoods (sources of income, challenges, opportunities)
●	Social Inclusion (types, conditions, awareness, participation, community attitudes, and barriers for PWD/FHHs)
●	Natural Resource Management (land, water, forest, non-timber forest products, minerals; utilization, governance, inclusivity)
●	Climate Change (knowledge, challenges, mitigation, and adaptation)
●	Training (knowledge, satisfaction, application)
●	Demographic characteristics (sex, literacy, household composition, ethnicity, age, marital status, education)
Data Analysis: The collected data was cleaned, uploaded, and subsequently analyzed using Kinaki software, which generated the statistical report.
Team Composition and Training: The fieldwork team had a diverse group, including trainers, supervisors, team leaders, and enumerators from ADRA Laos, NaBCAP staff, and representatives from government departments such as DAFO (Department of Agriculture and Forestry), DONRE (Department of Natural Resources and Environment), Planning, District Admin, LWU (Lao Women's Union), LSW (Department of Labour and Social Welfare), and DHO (District Health Office). A driver and external consultants from Salanga (for analysis and software support) also complemented the team.
A two-day training program was organized for the enumerators to familiarize them with the questionnaires, data collection tools, and equipment. This training combined theoretical sessions, covering an overview of NaBCAP's Monitoring & Evaluation frameworks, tools, indicators, and targets, with practical demonstrations and one-on-one practice sessions.
Timelines: The overall timeline for the baseline survey process included software setup (October 2024), survey design and setup (November 2024), enumerator training (April 2025), data collection (April 2025), data analysis (April 2025), and reporting (June 2025).
Data Quality Assurance: To ensure data quality, data was collected offline and uploaded upon internet connection. Supervisors were available to provide troubleshooting and remote support, and they conducted daily spot checks and data validation with assistance from the software team.
Ethical Considerations: Enumerators were required to provide an introduction to respondents detailing the survey's purpose, privacy considerations, and confidentiality. Consent was sought before proceeding with questions, and refusals to participate were respected, resulting in the immediate termination of the survey. Enumerators were trained in local customs and language, and specific protocols were in place regarding interviewing the opposite sex and seeking spousal permission for Hmong female respondents when practical.

Survey Analysis and Findings: Demographic Profile
This section presents a demographic analysis of the baseline survey participants, highlighting key characteristics that inform the contextual understanding for the NaBCAP project. The findings are based on a total of 378 surveyed households and individuals.
Demographic Summary
The baseline survey covered a total of 378 households across different social and economic profiles. A significant majority (60.3%) of households were categorized as poor, emphasizing the need for poverty-responsive interventions. Female respondents made up 60.3% of participants, and nearly 56% of all individuals came from households that included PWD. 
Ethnic diversity was notable, with Lao Lum (48.9%), Lao Soung (28.8%), and Lao Therng (14.8%) represented, requiring culturally inclusive project strategies. Education data shows that 35% of respondents never attended school, 45.8% completed only primary education, and just 19% reached higher levels. These findings underline the need for inclusive, accessible, and culturally adapted project activities, especially in communication, training, and decision-making processes.
1. Household Economic Status (see Pie charts as annexes)
The economic status of the surveyed households revealed a significant proportion classified as poor.
●	Out of 378 surveyed households:
○	228 households (60.3%) were identified as poor.
○	84 households (22.2%) were classified as non-poor.
○	66 households (17.5%) fell into the category of "other," which may include those who did not identify their status clearly or fall outside typical economic classifications.
Considerations for the project: The prevalence of poor households underscores the critical need for targeted support. Project interventions should prioritize livelihood strengthening, access to essential services, and resilience-building activities specifically for households with the highest level of vulnerabilities. It is also important to have clarity on the socio-economic status of the "other" group to ensure their needs are adequately addressed and they are not inadvertently excluded from project benefits.
2. Gender Distribution
The gender distribution among survey participants indicates a higher representation of females, with a notable proportion from households with persons with disabilities (PWDs).
●	The survey included 378 individuals, with the following gender breakdown:
○	150 males (39.7%)
○	228 females (60.3%)
○	98 males (26.0%) were from households with persons with disabilities (PWDs).
○	113 females (29.9%) also from PWD households.
Considerations for the project: The higher proportion of female respondents and significant participation from households with persons with disabilities highlight the necessity of gender-sensitive and disability-inclusive approaches. This requires accessible program design, targeted awareness-raising initiatives, and ensuring both women and persons with disabilities can meaningfully participate in and derive equitable benefits from project interventions.
3. Marital Status
Most respondents reported being married (n=279; 73.9%), indicating that most households are headed by married individuals. A notable proportion of respondents were widowed (n=67; 17.8%), reflecting the presence of single-headed households due to spousal loss. A smaller group identified as single, having never married (n=19; 5.0%). Very few respondents reported their status as widower (n=4; 1.1%) or separated (n=1; 0.3%), and no respondents selected the “other” category (n=0; 0.0%). The distribution indicates that the surveyed population is predominantly married, with widowhood as the second most prevalent status, while other categories are comparatively small.
4. Ethnicity Distribution
The ethnic composition of the participants reflects the diverse cultural landscape of the project area.
●	Participants in the survey belonged to the following ethnic groups:
○	Lao Lum (Lao-Tai): 185 individuals (48.9%)
○	Lao Soung (Hmong-Mien): 109 individuals (28.8%)
○	Lao Therng (Mon-Khmer): 56 individuals (14.8%)
○	Other ethnicities: 28 individuals (7.4%)
Considerations for the project: The diverse ethnic makeup, with nearly half of the population being Lao Lum and substantial representation from Lao Soung and Lao Therng minority groups, necessitates cultural sensitivity in project implementation. This includes providing translated materials or support in minority languages where required. All activities should be designed to be inclusive and respectful of diverse traditional norms and practices to ensure equitable engagement and benefit across all ethnic groups.
5. Education Levels by Gender
The analysis of education levels disaggregated by gender reveals significant disparities and overall low educational attainment among the surveyed population.
Table 1.
Education Level	Male	Female	Total
Never attended school	23	109	132
Primary school	75	98	173
Lower secondary school	31	23	54
Upper secondary school	16	15	31
Vocational school	2	2	4
College/University	1	3	4
Other	2	1	3
Key Observations:
●	A substantial number of individuals, particularly females (109), and a notable number of males (23) reported never having attended school. This represents a significant barrier to information access and engagement through traditional literacy-dependent methods (trainings?).
●	Most of the respondents are married (73.9%), followed by widowed (17.8%), with a smaller portion that answered single (5%).
●	The largest proportion of respondents (173 individuals) completed only primary education, indicating very limited formal schooling across the population.
●	Very few participants reached higher education levels, such as vocational training, college, or university, highlighting a lack of advanced skills and formal qualifications within the surveyed communities.
Considerations for the project: The identified low education levels, especially pronounced among women, suggest the need for simplified communication strategies. These should prioritize visual aids and oral methods for effective dissemination and comprehension. Capacity-building components and training initiatives within the project must be designed to be inclusive and practical with hands-on demonstrations without requiring substantive levels of literacy to ensure broad participation.
Survey Analysis and Findings: Key Project Indicators
This section provides baseline data for key project indicators obtained using the Kinaki software, offering an initial overview of the important figures related to NaBCAP's objectives. These findings will serve as benchmarks against the future progress that will be measured.
Project Result 1. 
Climate vulnerable households have increased livelihood opportunities by applying nature-based solutions approaches.
Indicator 1.1: 
Percentage of Vulnerable Households Reported Increased Yields through Improved Agricultural Production and Alternative Resources

This indicator measures the proportion of vulnerable households, disaggregated by gender and disability status, that reported an increase in yields attributable to improved agricultural practices (livestock and cultivation) and engagement with alternative resources (small grants and new skills). 
Baseline Findings for Indicator 1.1:
Table 2.
Demographic Group	Percentage Reporting Increased Yields
Male	39.33% (59.0 out of 150)
Female	28.07% (64.0 out of 228)
Male PWD HH	41.84% (41.0 out of 98)
Female PWD HH	23.89% (27.0 out of 113)
FHH	26.23% (16.0 out of 61)
Overall	32.54% (123.0 out of 378)
Key Observations for Indicator 1.1:
●	Overall, approximately one-third (32.54%) of all surveyed households reported increased yields at baseline, suggesting a pre-existing level of positive agricultural outcomes or perceptions or indicating areas where improvements have already begun.
●	Male respondents reported a higher percentage of increased yields (39.33%) compared to female respondents (28.07%), indicating a gender disparity in perceived agricultural success or access to yield-enhancing factors.
●	Within households with persons with disabilities (PWD HHs), male PWD households reported a higher percentage (41.84%) than female PWD households (23.89%). This further emphasizes the gender gap, even within vulnerable groups.
●	Female-headed households (FHH) showed a relatively low percentage (26.23%) of reported increased yields, aligning with the general trend for female respondents.
Considerations for the project: The project should investigate the underlying reasons for the observed gender disparities in reported yield increases. This could involve exploring differences in access to resources, land, training, or decision-making power between male and female farmers, including those in PWD households and female-headed households. Interventions should be specifically designed to address these inequalities to ensure equitable benefits from improved agricultural production and alternative resource utilization. Tailored support and training may be necessary for female farmers and female PWD households to enhance their yields and economic gains.
Indicator 1.2: 
Percentage of Community Members Expressing Improved Access and Control Over Livelihood Opportunities

This indicator shows the percentage of community members, categorized by gender and disability status, who recognize improved access to resources that support livelihoods and increased control over these resources.
Baseline Findings for Indicator 1.2:
Table 3.
Demographic Group	Percentage Expressing Improved Access and Control
Male	24.67% (37.0 out of 150)
Female	12.72% (29.0 out of 228)
Male PWD HH	28.57% (28.0 out of 98)
Female PWD HH	12.39% (14.0 out of 113)
FHH	4.92% (3.0 out of 61)
Overall	17.46% (66.0 out of 378)
Key Observations for Indicator 1.2:
●	Overall, only a small proportion of community members (17.46%) reported improved access to and control over their livelihood opportunities at the baseline. This highlights a significant area for project intervention to improve empowerment and access to resources.
●	A notable gender gap exists, with male respondents (24.67%) reporting nearly double the percentage of improved access and control compared to female respondents (12.72%).
●	Within PWD households, male PWD households (28.57%) again reported higher percentages than female PWD households (12.39%), repeating similar gender disparity.
●	Female-headed households (FHH) showed the lowest percentage (4.92%), indicating this group faces more challenges in accessing and controlling livelihood opportunities.
Considerations for the project: The very low baseline for perceived access and control over livelihood opportunities, especially among female respondents and female-headed households. This indicates a strong need for direct and targeted interventions. The project should focus on empowering these vulnerable groups by facilitating access to essential resources, financial services, and market linkages. Strategies must actively reduce the barriers, ensuring women and FHHs have a stronger voice and participation in the decision-making processes related to their livelihoods. Gender and disability inclusion strategies within economic empowerment initiatives will be crucial for improving these baseline figures over the project's duration.

Project Result 2. 
Communities and stakeholders have effective land and water management systems by adopting nature-based solution approaches.

Indicator 2.1: 
Percentage of Households Stating Improved Forest Protection and Management

This indicator assesses the households that perceive an improvement in forest protection and management, considering existing mechanisms.

Baseline Findings for Indicator 2.1:
Table 4.
Demographic Group	Percentage Stating Improved Forest Protection and Management
Male	68.0% (102.0 out of 150)
Female	43.86% (100.0 out of 228)
Male PWD HH	67.35% (66.0 out of 98)
Female PWD HH	39.82% (45.0 out of 113)
FHH	42.62% (26.0 out of 61)
Overall	53.44% (202.0 out of 378)
Key Observations for Indicator 2.1:
●	Overall, more than half of the surveyed households (53.44%) reported improved forest protection and management at baseline. This suggests a foundational awareness of existing practices that the project can build upon.
●	A significant gender disparity is evident, with males (68.0%) reporting a higher perception of improved forest management compared to females (43.86%).
●	Within PWD households, male PWD households (67.35%) reported a similarly high perception to the general male population, while female PWD households (39.82%) reported lower levels, consistent with the overall female trend.
●	Female-headed households (FHH) also reported a comparatively lower percentage (42.62%), indicating that this group may face specific challenges or have different perspectives regarding forest management.
Considerations for the project: The project should investigate the reasons behind the gender differences in perceived forest protection and management. This may involve assessing women's participation in forest management decision-making, access to information, and direct involvement in protective measures. Project activities should aim to enhance women's and female PWD households' engagement in community forest management plans and practices to ensure more equal participation and increase their perception. 
Indicator 2.2: 
Percentage of Households Stating They Have an Effective Land Use Plan

This indicator measures the proportion of households that perceive having an effective land use plan, considering existing mechanisms and their perceived efficiency. 
Baseline Findings for Indicator 2.2:
Table 5.
Demographic Group	Percentage Stating Effective Land Use Plan
Male	52.0% (78.0 out of 150)
Female	32.02% (73.0 out of 228)
Male PWD HH	51.02% (50.0 out of 98)
Female PWD HH	27.43% (31.0 out of 113)
FHH	31.15% (19.0 out of 61)
Overall	39.95% (151.0 out of 378)
Key Observations for Indicator 2.2:
●	In total, just under 40% (39.95%) of surveyed households reported having an effective land use plan at baseline, indicating a significant opportunity for the project to strengthen land management practices.
●	Like forest management, there is a clear gender disparity, with males (52.0%) reporting a much higher perception of effective land use plans compared to females (32.02%).
●	PWD households, male PWD households (51.02%) maintained a higher perception than female PWD households (27.43%), reinforcing the gender gap.
●	Female-headed households (FHH) reported a low percentage (31.15%), aligning with the overall trend for female respondents. Again highlighting the potential cultural barriers to being actively involved in project activities.
Considerations for the project: The project should prioritize increasing awareness and participation in land use planning, especially among women and female-headed households. Interventions should focus on developing inclusive land use plans that reflect the needs and priorities of all community members. Activities must ensure equitable access to information, resources, and decision-making processes related to land management. Training and capacity-building efforts should address specific barriers faced by women and vulnerable groups.
Project Result 3. 
Communities and implementing partners have increased access to inclusive and climate action services in Lao PDR through advocacy.
Indicator 3.1: 
Percentage of Households Stating They Have Increased Capacity to Advocate for Their Needs

This indicator measures the proportion of households, disaggregated by gender and disability status, that report an increased capacity to advocate for their needs, based on their understanding of challenges, knowledge of services, and perception that their concerns are considered.
Baseline Findings for Indicator 3.1:
Table 6.
Demographic Group	Percentage Stating Increased Capacity to Advocate
Male	42.0% (63.0 out of 150)
Female	13.16% (30.0 out of 228)
Male PWD HH	42.86% (42.0 out of 98)
Female PWD HH	11.5% (13.0 out of 113)
FHH	16.39% (10.0 out of 61)
Overall	24.6% (93.0 out of 378)
Key Observations for Indicator 3.1:
●	Overall, approximately a quarter (24.6%) of surveyed households at baseline reported an increased capacity to advocate for their needs. This highlights a significant area for the project to build community voice and influence.
●	A substantial gender disparity is evident, with males (42.0%) reporting a much higher perceived capacity for advocacy compared to females (13.16%). This suggests significant barriers for women in articulating their needs and having them heard.
●	Within PWD households, male PWD households (42.86%) reported a high perceived capacity for advocacy, consistent with the general male trend. The extremely low percentage of female PWD households (11.5%) in contrast suggests that advocacy for women with disabilities is even more difficult.
●	Female-headed households (FHH) also showed a low percentage (16.39%), aligning with the overall trend for female respondents and underscoring their limited engagement or effectiveness in advocacy.
Considerations for the project: The significant disparity in advocacy capacity, especially among female respondents, female PWD households, and female-headed households, necessitates targeted intervention. The project should implement specific strategies to empower these vulnerable groups to advocate for their needs effectively. This includes strengthening their understanding of their rights, providing training on communication and negotiation skills, creating safe and inclusive platforms for voicing concerns, and actively facilitating their participation in decision-making processes at various levels.
Indicator 3.3. 
Percentage increased in access to inclusive and climate action services in Lao PDR through advocacy

Baseline findings for indicator 3.3.
Table 7.
Group	% Reporting Improved Access	Numerator/Denominator
Male	7.33%	11/150
Female	3.95%	9 / 228
Male PWD HH	11.22%	11/98
Female PWD HH	6.19%	7 / 113
Female-Headed HH (FHH)	3.28%	2 / 61
Overall	5.29%	20 / 378

Key Observations for Indicator 3.3:
●	Very low perceived access to inclusive climate action services. 
●	Only 5.3% of households feel they have improved access to inclusive and climate action-related services, indicating weak outreach, visibility, or delivery mechanisms at the community level. Indicates project-related activities at very initial stages.
●	Gender Inequality in Service Access Men (7.33%) are nearly twice as likely as women (3.95%) to report improved access. This disparity suggests barriers for women in information access and participation in public or community platforms.
●	Vulnerable households are marginalized. Female PWD HHs (6.19%) and female-headed HHs (3.28%) report the lowest access, reflecting multiple, overlapping barriers such as social norms, physical accessibility, and lack of targeted outreach.
●	Limited community participation and engagement at this point. Participation in village meetings and perception of inclusive services need to be strengthened at the grassroots level.
Considerations for the Project: To improve access to inclusive and climate-related services, the project should make services more visible through village-level information sessions and materials in local languages. Targeted outreach is needed to reach women, people with disabilities (PWDs), and female-headed households (FHHs), such as home visits and inclusive group discussions in accessible spaces. Community participation should be encouraged by holding meetings at flexible times and offering support like transportation or childcare. Feedback from households should be actively collected and linked to action by local authorities. Finally, perceptions of access should be tracked by group at midline and endline to guide adaptive planning.
Conclusion
The baseline survey for the Nature-Based Social Inclusive Livelihood and Climate Action Project (NaBCAP) in Kham District, Xiengkhouang Province, has provided crucial insights into the demographic profile and initial conditions relevant to key project indicators. The findings highlight a community dealing with significant socio-economic vulnerabilities and disparities, which directly impact their capacity for sustainable livelihood development, natural resource management, and advocating for their needs.
A considerable majority of the surveyed households (60.3%) were identified as poor, underscoring the critical need for targeted poverty-responsive interventions. The demographic data also revealed a positive representation of female respondents (60.3%) and individuals from households with persons with disabilities (nearly 56%). The results also demonstrated communities with a diverse ethnic composition. These results call for approaches to be culturally sensitive, gender-responsive, and disability-inclusive across all project activities. The evident low educational level, particularly among women, points to a clear need for simplified and accessible communication and capacity-building strategies that do not rely heavily on literacy.
Analysis of the key project indicators at baseline shows several areas requiring substantial intervention:
●	Livelihood Opportunities and Agricultural Production: While approximately one-third of households reported increased yields, a significant gender gap was observed, with males consistently reporting higher gains than females, including within PWD households. More concerning, only a small fraction (17.46% overall) of community members perceived improved access to and control over their livelihood opportunities, with particularly low figures for females and female-headed households. This indicates limited economic empowerment and agency among the most vulnerable groups.
●	Land and Water Management Systems: Perceptions of improved forest protection and management were moderate (53.44% overall) but marked by a significant gender disparity, with males reporting much higher perceptions than females. Similarly, less than 40% of households reported effective land use plans, again showing a notable gender gap and lower engagement among female and female-headed households. These figures suggest that existing management systems may not be fully equitable or effective for all community members.
●	Capacity to Advocate for Needs: The most striking finding was the extremely low baseline for perceived advocacy capacity (24.6% overall), with an alarming disparity where males reported significantly higher capacity (42.0%) compared to females (13.16%), female PWD households (11.5%), and female-headed households (16.39%). This indicates a profound challenge in ensuring the voices of vulnerable groups are heard and considered in decision-making processes. Even lower perceptions regarding inclusive climate services.
In conclusion, the baseline data affirms that NaBCAP operates within a context of poverty, gender inequality, and social exclusion, which intersect with challenges in natural resource management and community governance. The current state, as revealed by these indicators, underscores the urgency and relevance of the project's multi-sectoral, inclusive, and nature-based solutions approaches. Achieving the project's goal of sustainable economic growth, environmental protection, climate resilience, and increased well-being for vulnerable farming communities will depend critically on effectively addressing these identified disparities and empowering marginalized groups to actively participate and benefit from interventions.
Recommendations
Based on the comprehensive analysis of the baseline survey findings, the following recommendations are put forth to guide the strategic implementation and adaptation of the NaBCAP project to maximize its impact and ensure equitable outcomes:
1.	Prioritize Targeted Livelihood and Agricultural Support for Vulnerable Groups:
○	Action: Design and deliver agricultural training, access to improved inputs, and alternative income-generating activities with a deliberate focus on poor households, female farmers, female-headed households (FHH), and households with persons with disabilities (PWD HHs).
2.	Enhance Equitable Access and Control Over Resources:
○	Action: Implement specific interventions aimed at strengthening access and control over livelihood resources for women, FHHs, and female PWD households. This may include facilitating access to microfinance, market linkages, and land tenure security. Vulnerable groups need to be directly empowered by the project activities.
3.	Promote Inclusive Natural Resource Management and Planning:
○	Action: Actively involve women, PWDs, and ethnic minorities in the development, implementation, and monitoring of community forest management plans (CFM) and land use plans. This should include ensuring their voices are central to decision-making processes regarding land and forest resources.
4.	Strengthen the Advocacy Capacity of Marginalized Groups:
○	Action: Develop and implement targeted capacity-building programs in advocacy, communication, and negotiation skills, specifically for women, female PWD households, and FHHs. Create safe and inclusive platforms that encourage their active participation in articulating their needs to local authorities and project stakeholders.
5.	Adopt Highly Accessible and Culturally Sensitive Communication and Training Strategies:
○	Action: Given the low education levels, especially among women, prioritize the use of visual aids, oral communication methods, and locally relevant languages for all project communications and training materials.
6.	Conduct Ongoing Monitoring and Adaptive Learning:
○	Action: Continuously monitor the project indicators with disaggregated data to track progress against these baselines and identify any persistent disparities or emerging challenges.
By implementing these recommendations, NaBCAP can more effectively address the multifaceted vulnerabilities identified in the baseline survey, foster genuine social inclusion, and empower all community members to contribute to and benefit from sustainable development and climate action.
